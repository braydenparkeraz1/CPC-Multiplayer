# Testing the helper without the game

`FakeGame.cs` builds a stand-in `carparkcapital.exe` that does what the mod's Lua side does: it reads the inbox
file, acks messages, prints `MP>` lines, "loads" a city on `loadworld` and exits on `leave`.
It can't test anything inside the real game (object/tile sync, pausing), only the helper and the network protocol.

## Setup

1. Build `FakeGame.cs` as `carparkcapital.exe` (any C# compiler targeting .NET Framework 4).
2. Make two game folders, `host` and `client`, each containing that exe plus these files
   (the installer patches them, so they need the anchor lines):
   - `assets/scripts/entities/3d/MainMenu.lua`: `function create(menu)` / `    setName(menu, "Menu")` / `end`
   - `assets/scripts/entities/simulation/GlobalStorage.lua`: `function create(entity)` / `    setName(entity, "Global Storage Entity")` / `end`
   - `assets/scripts/entities/simulation/_catalogue.lua`: anything
   - an empty `saves/` folder
3. Keep every path under 260 characters: .NET Framework apps won't start from longer paths.

## Running

```
CPC-Multiplayer.exe host --game <host> --name Hosty --port 27877 --allow-second-instance
CPC-Multiplayer.exe join 127.0.0.1:27877 --game <client> --name Clienty --allow-second-instance
```

Drive a fake game by writing one command to `control.txt` in its folder:
`level` (load a city and autosave it), `menu`, `save`, `exit`.
Set `FAKEGAME_IGNORE_LEAVE=1` for the client to check the helper force-closes a game that doesn't close.
Each fake game logs what it received to `fakegame.log`; the helpers log to `multiplayer/runtime/helper-*.log`.

## Scenarios checked for 0.3.0

| Scenario | Expected |
|---|---|
| Host `level`, client joins | Client gets `loadworld` and is "in the host's city" |
| Host `menu` | Client game gets `leave` and exits, the helper restarts it, client rejoins after host `level` |
| Host types `quit` | Client game gets `leave` and exits, the client helper exits, `saves/MP_*.cpcp` deleted |
| Host helper killed | Client sees the connection drop and closes its game |
| Client game ignores `leave` | Helper kills it after 8 s |
| Host helper frozen (suspended) | Client gives up after 20 s without data |
